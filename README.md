# Code
Code for the experiments conducted in this thesis.

It encompasses everything to reproduce the reported results. An *.environment*-file is provided for convenient installation of the necessary tools with conda environments. For problems during installation of PyTorch Geometric, please refer to their [extensive guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/).

The *notebook*-folder contains a collection of examplary notebooks for graph classification, transfer learning and graph representation learning. 
The *src*-folder comprises the code for the models, training pipelines and other mandatory utilities. 
Lastly, the *test*-folder contains a few tests, although they cover only the bare minimum. This is due to the fact that the proposed model is intended to be a proof of concept (POC) only. Moreover, the utilized libraries are carefully tested on their own.

The required data sets can be found [here](https://github.com/MA-CIT1806/Data).
